# Fix
An ultra-lightweight web glue for .NET, written in C#.
## README needs updating
This README is out of date. I've just picked Fix up again to use with Simple.Web, so the information below is wrong. I'll update it soon.
MR 21-Jul-2012
## What?
Fix joins together web servers, request handlers and "infixes", or middleware, in such a way that the implementations of each don't need to know anything about each other, or, indeed, about Fix itself.
### Example?
Hello again. I've completely failed to update this, but I have at least deleted the old wrong examples.

I'd love to hear people's thoughts on this. Best way is to catch me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/markrendle).
